## VSDBabySoC: An Open-Source RISC-V SoC for Learning and Experimentation

<div align="center"></div>

**VSDBabySoC** is a compact, open-source System on Chip (SoC) built on the Sky130 technology platform. Centered around the **RVMYTH RISC-V processor core**, this SoC integrates a **Phase-Locked Loop (PLL)** for precise clock generation and a **10-bit Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC)** for interfacing with the analog world.

The primary mission of this project is to provide a fully transparent, highly documented, and educational platform for students, hobbyists, and professionals. It serves as a practical guide for learning digital-analog interfacing, open-source IP integration, and the complete RTL-to-GDSII flow. By converting digital signals into analog outputs, the VSDBabySoC can communicate with devices like televisions and mobile phones, enabling it to produce audio or video signals.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow

1. **Initialization and Clock Generation:** The PLL locks onto a reference clock and generates a stable, high-frequency signal to synchronize the system.
2. **Data Processing:** The RVMYTH core executes programs that load 10-bit digital values into a DAC-connected register.
3. **Analog Signal Generation:** The DAC converts each digital value into an analog voltage, driving devices like amplifiers or display inputs.
